Vercont is a program that allows to store different versions of chosen data. There is a lot of similar software, but Vercont is designed to be a very easy solution for simple tasks.

Imagine, someone is writing a document, a text just like this one. It would be nice to have different versions of the text during writing, wouldn't be? To have the possibility of changing everything without fear and to being able to revert to the previous version anytime.

Of course one could set up a CVS or SVN repository. It is great however looks like killing a fly with a tank. Mac OSX users may want to use Time Machine, but it is rather a backup utility and rather it is not portable.

Vercont may be a good solution here, as well as a tool for small application development, extreme programming and so on. Every task related to storing different versions and branches of files, which do not need the extra multiuser server repository, may be easily performed via Vercont.
